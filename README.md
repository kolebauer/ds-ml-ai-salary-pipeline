# Data Science Salary Prediction Dataset (2020â€“2025)

This repository currently hosts the dataset used for a machine learning project focused on predicting salaries in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

The data includes salary information from 2020 through 2025, with attributes such as:
- Job title
- Experience level
- Company size and location
- Remote work ratio
- Employment type
- Reported and converted salaries (USD)

The purpose of this repository is to support the development and sharing of a complete ML pipeline that explores salary trends and builds predictive models based on real-world tech job data.
